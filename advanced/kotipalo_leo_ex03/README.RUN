Problem 1
---------
Code in p01/

Compilation:
	make

Run:
	./kmc.exe SEED
	SEED is the seed used, default 1

The output is a table of results with standard errors for a hundred 1 us runs with different temperatures, and the survival ratio for a run with 10 Ã… recombination radius.
Progress is printed in stderr output, so be sure to redirect either output stream for more readable output.

Example output in p01/out_01.txt, generated with:
	./kmc.exe > out_01.txt
